          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Welcome to the Invaluable.Market website. d/b/a Invaluable.Market (“Invaluable.Market,”
            “we,” “us” or “our”). These Terms of Use (these “Terms”) govern your access to and use
            of the Invaluable.Market website; including without limitation the creation, purchase,
            sale, exchange, or modification of certain digital assets; our online and/or mobile
            services, and software provided on or in connection with those services (collectively,
            the “Service”).
          </p>
          <p>
            This Service also allows you to sell and purchase Crypto Assets (as defined below) via
            auction (“Auction”). Detailed rules regarding the Auction process are available on this
            page, Auction Rules. You may only participate in the Auction by linking your digital
            wallets on supported bridge extensions such as MetaMask (https://metamask.io/). MetaMask
            is an electronic wallet, which allows you to purchase, store, and engage in transactions
            using Ethereum cryptocurrency. Before putting up your unique digital asset for Auction
            or putting in an offer to purchase a unique digital asset from another user, we will ask
            you to download a supported electronic wallet extension, and connect and unlock your
            digital wallets with that extension. Once you submit an order to sell or purchase a
            unique digital asset, your order is passed on to the applicable extension, which
            completes the transaction on your behalf.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Crypto Assets” refers to unique non-fungible tokens, implemented on the Ethereum
            blockchain (the “Ethereum Platform”) using smart contracts, including without limitation
            Ethmoji, CryptoKitties, CryptoCelebrities, and CryptoPunks.
          </p>
          <p>
            ALL TRANSACTIONS INITIATED THROUGH OUR SERVICE ARE FACILITATED AND RUN BY THIRD-PARTY
            ELECTRONIC WALLET EXTENSIONS, AND BY USING OUR SERVICES YOU AGREE THAT YOU ARE GOVERNED
            BY THE TERMS OF SERVICE AND PRIVACY POLICY FOR THE APPLICABLE EXTENSIONS. FOR METAMASK,
            THOSE TERMS ARE AVAILABLE AT (https://metamask.io/terms.html) AND
            (https://metamask.io/privacy.html)

          <p>
            Because we have a growing number of services, we sometimes need to describe additional
            terms for specific services. Those additional terms and conditions, which are available
            with the relevant services, then become part of your agreement with us if you use those
            services.

          <p>
            THESE TERMS OF USE ARE IMPORTANT AND AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, SO PLEASE READ THEM
            CAREFULLY. WE WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THE TERMS INCLUDE AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WHICH
            WILL, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, REQUIRE DISPUTES BETWEEN US TO BE SUBMITTED TO BINDING
            AND FINAL ARBITRATION. UNLESS YOU OPT OUT OF THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT: (1) YOU WILL
            ONLY BE PERMITTED TO PURSUE CLAIMS AND SEEK RELIEF AGAINST US ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS,
            NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING;
            AND (2) YOU ARE AGREEING TO MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION FOR THE RESOLUTION OF
            DISPUTES AND WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL ON YOUR CLAIMS. PLEASE READ SECTION 15
            CAREFULLY.
